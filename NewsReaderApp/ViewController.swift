The coast is frequently praised for its rugged coastline and mountain views. As the longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the continental United States, it has been described as a national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development, and one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation. Big Sur's Cone Peak at 5,155 feet (1,571 m) is only 3 miles (5 km) from the ocean.[5] The stunning views make Big Sur a popular tourist destination."
